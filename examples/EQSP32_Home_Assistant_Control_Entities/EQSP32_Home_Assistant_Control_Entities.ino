#include "EQSP32.h"

/* 
  In this example we will demonstrate how to create custom interfaces to interact with Home Assistant.
  The custom interfaces might any of the sensor interfaces:
  WATER_CONSUMPTION_SENSOR, VOLUME_STORAGE_SENSOR, VOLUME_FLOW_RATE_SENSOR, PRECIPITATION_INTENSITY_SENSOR
  Any of the control interfaces:
  SWITCH, BUTTON, VALVE, INTEGER_VALUE, FLOAT_VALUE
  And any custom sensor or binary sensor is supported by the MQTT integration in Home Assistnat (also mentioned in EQSP32.h)

  We create two "button" or BUTTON interfaces and one "switch" or SWITCH. These will appear in home assistant and we will be able to accept commands.
  For the SWITCH interface we may also update its state after processing the command, so there is feedback to home assistant.

  For the most advanced approach we may create custom sensors and binary sensors, which we will update with our measurements.
  These will be also be available in home assistant.

  All control interfaces can also be written. This means that for every BUTTON or SWITCH, we can generate the commands ourselves by using
  the writeInterfaceSTRING function.
